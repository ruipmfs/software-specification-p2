report:
  - bug 1:
      type: Null Dereference
      lineno: 76
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Infer. Null dereference when accessing 'map' without checking for null."
      recommendation: "Ensure that 'map' is not null before accessing its members."
  
  - bug 2:
      type: Memory Leak
      lineno: 130
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Infer. 'entries' variable does not free when calling hashmap_set()"
      recommendation: "Free 'entries' memory when it's no longer needed."
  
  - bug 3:
      type: Memory Leak
      lineno: 156
      class: fp
      description: "Bug found with Infer. We need to return the pointer 'val', so we can't free it in the function"
      recommendation: "Free the pointer 'ret' in the main()"

    - bug 4:
      type: Null Dereference
      lineno: 156
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Infer. Null dereference when accessing 'val' without checking for null."
      recommendation: "Ensure that 'val' is not null before accessing it."
  
  - bug 5:
      type: Nullptr Dereference
      lineno: 163
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Infer. Potential null pointer dereference when calling 'hashmap_new()'."
      recommendation: "Ensure that the 'fields' in hashmap_new() is not null when created"

  - bug 6:
      type: Null Dereference
      lineno: 72
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Clang Analyzer. Dereferencing a null pointer when accessing 'field->size'."
      recommendation: "Ensure that 'field' is not null before accessing its members."

  - bug 7:
      type: Buffer Overflow
      lineno: 124
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Clang Analyzer. sizeof() does not insure the length of the string is the correct length"
      recommendation: "Ensure that memory allocation is based on the appropriate size, such as 'strlen(key) + 1' for null-terminated strings."

  - bug 8:
      type: Memory Leak
      lineno: 170
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Clang Analyzer. We need to free ret on main(), since it is returned from a malloc() in hashmap_get()"
      recommendation: "Free ret on main()"

  - bug 9:
      type: Buffer Overflow
      lineno: 125
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Clang Analyzer. Call to function 'strcpy' is insecure and may result in a buffer overflow, as it does not provide bounding of the memory buffer."
      recommendation: "Replace 'strcpy' with 'strncpy' and specify the 'key' length (strlen(key)+1 for null-terminated strings)"
  
  - bug 10:
      type: Buffer Overflow
      lineno: 132
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Clang Analyzer. Call to function 'memcpy' is insecure as it does not provide security checks."
      recommendation: "Replace 'memcpy' with 'memcpy_s' or other functions that provide length arguments to ensure secure memory copying."

  - bug 11:
      type: Buffer Overflow
      lineno: 138
      class: tp
      description: "Bug found with Clang Analyzer. Call to function 'memcpy' is insecure as it does not provide security checks."
      recommendation: "Replace 'memcpy' with 'memcpy_s' or other functions that provide length arguments to ensure secure memory copying."

  - bug 12:
      type: Buffer Overflow
